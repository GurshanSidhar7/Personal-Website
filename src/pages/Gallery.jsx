        <img src="/gallery_image/gursh_speech.png" alt="My Picture" className="about-image" />
        <p className="about-description">Hey, I'm Gurshan!  I'm a second-year Computer Science student minoring in Statistics at 
          Wilfrid Laurier University. I love diving into problem-solving, working with data, 
          and building creative projects that blend my passions with modern technology. Outside of tech, I'm passionate about 
          photography, gaming, cooking, films and snowboarding. Capturing moments through a lens is something I really enjoyâ€”it's a way 
          to freeze time and tell a story without words. Music also plays a huge role in my life; there's nothing better 
          than finding the perfect song to match a moment, whether it's a photo I've taken or just a feeling in the air.  
          Below, you'll find a small gallery of my photography, each paired with a song that perfectly matches its vibe.
